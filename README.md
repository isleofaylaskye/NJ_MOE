Codebook for Analyzing MOE in NJ EJ law designations

3 Jupyter Notebooks:
1. mainfile.ipynb (editing source data, creating confidence intervals, mapping and vizualizing results)
2. JCS.ipynb (edits data for use in Joint Count Statistics analysis in GEODA)
3. analysis_by_class.ipynb (I somehow lost the code for this one? Maybe you can find it in history? But it was pretty short and basically calculates and plots mean MOE for each of the four classes)
